      <h4>July,2025 - Present</h4>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        As a Junior Electrical Engineer specializing in Testing and Commissioning, I have been actively involved in the
        execution and validation of LV and MV electrical systems, including switchgear, transformers, protection relays,
        and control panels. My role includes performing critical tests such as insulation resistance, CT/PT ratio and
        polarity checks, breaker timing analysis, and functional relay logic verification to ensure system integrity and
        operational safety. I collaborate closely with senior engineers, consultants, and site managers to maintain
        strict compliance with industry standards, safety protocols, and project specifications.

        Additionally, I am responsible for preparing detailed test reports and documentation in accordance with client
        and regulatory requirements. My experience also includes coordination with OEM vendors during Factory Acceptance
        Tests (FAT) and Site Acceptance Tests (SAT), as well as troubleshooting and resolving issues that arise during
        commissioning activities. With hands-on knowledge of testing instruments like Omicron and Megger, and a working
        understanding of IEC and IS standards, I contribute to successful project handovers with a focus on reliability,
        safety, and performance.
        As part of the electrical meter installation and networking team, I am responsible for the physical
        installation, configuration, and network integration of smart meters. My work involves ensuring seamless
        communication between the meters and the central network, as well as troubleshooting connectivity issues.
